<h2>Important trends and challenges in fintech</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>“Blockchain will fundamentally change financial systems… It will be applied in many areas because it is about trust, credit, security and the privacy of data”</em><em>Jack Ma, founder of Alibaba and co-founder at ANT Group.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The financial technology market keeps evolving, prompting more companies to try out innovative solutions. Let’s look at the most important trends that could influence your approach to fintech product development.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>AI and Machine Learning</strong>.<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/1-trillion-impact-from-artificial-intelligence-services-lex-sokolin/">&nbsp;Autonomous Research</a>&nbsp;predicts that Artificial Intelligence will help financial service firms reduce costs by 22% by 2023. The reason is simple: AI and machine-learning-powered platforms allow companies to analyze large blocks of data and truly make informed decisions. Furthermore, advanced algorithms help prevent fraudulent activities and unsanctioned account access.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Blockchain</strong>. A decentralized P2P ledger technology that stores time-stamped blocks of unmodifiable data, blockchain is all about transparency and data privacy. This helps build trustful relationships between users and service providers. Expect the fintech landscape to be driven by this technology.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Microservices</strong>. Many fintech apps are built as a set of interconnected modular blocks with decentralized data management. This approach has made online payment, investment, and&nbsp;<a href="https://relevant.software/blog/money-lending-app-relevants-guide/">money lending apps</a>&nbsp;more responsive for users and easy to maintain for engineers.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Big Data</strong>. The amount of data gathered from devices daily is estimated in quintillions. Big Data allows fintech companies to transform raw data into insightful information about customer’s behavior. This helps create the most effective marketing strategies and development opportunities.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Cybersecurity</strong>. According to the<a href="https://www.communitybanking.org/~/media/files/publication/cb21publication_2019.pdf">&nbsp;2019 CSBS Survey</a>, 70% of bankers consider security the most pressing concern for future profitability. It gets worse: data breaches cost up to $18.3 million per company based on the<a href="https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/whitepapers/unlocking-value-improved-cybersecurity-protection-w-7174">&nbsp;2020 Accenture’s Cost of Cybercrime Study</a>. In other words, SaaS companies and institutions in fintech must focus on security measures above all else.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Digital banks</strong>. Over 31% of respondents are using banking services via online apps, according to the<a href="https://www.provident.bank/press-releases/provident-bank-study-shows-shift-to-digital-banking-is-here-to-stay-following-covid-19-crisis">&nbsp;2020 Study by Provident Bank</a>, and only 7% don’t use digital banking (and the vast majority of them are well over the age of 50). This means the digital banking domain is going to be the go-to option for customers who prefer convenient transactions and fund management.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Autonomous finances</strong>. Financial technologies can help users make decisions about where to spend or invest their money. Just like navigation apps create the optimal route for your destination, autonomous finance apps use AI to help customers make the most out of their money. Autonomous finance is still in its early stages, but it’s a trend companies driven by innovation should look out for.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The fintech landscape is currently driven by AI and automation. These trends are universal for all types of financial technology applications.</p>
