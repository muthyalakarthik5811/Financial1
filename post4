<h4>Payment Gateways</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Electronic payment systems had been around even before e-commerce was born. These online payment gateways have revolutionized payment, making it convenient, easy, and highly accessible for all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most notable contribution of payment gateways is that they allow people to send money without the need for a bank. By removing the expensive bank fees,&nbsp;<a href="https://financesonline.com/c/payment-providers/">payment gateways</a>&nbsp;have given consumers considerable benefits and savings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Aside from these advantages, fintechs are also upgrading the security aspects of online payment gateways. For instance, fintechs are developing blockchain-based systems to make electronic money transfers more secure and cost-effective, compared to banks.</p>

<h4>Mobile Payments</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2019-global-digital-overview">With 5.11 billion unique mobile users worldwide</a>, it’s not surprising global mobile payment transactions will be worth over $1 trillion in 2019. By 2023, that figure is expected to exceed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/mobile-payments-market">US$4.3 trillion</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Indeed, the global diffusion of mobile payments is nothing short of being phenomenal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s no wonder fintech firms are constantly improving their products and services to better serve consumers everywhere. Advancements in mobile wallet technology, digital authentication, and NFC are spearheading these developments.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If a cashless society is something that’s still quite impossible to achieve, a physical credit card-less world is fast approaching to happen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<h4>Budgeting Apps</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>People used to take the time–often in a quiet area in their homes–to calculate their expenses and make appropriate budgets. Monitoring finances commonly involve navigating through spreadsheets and rummaging through paper receipts and checks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today–thanks to budgeting apps–monitoring expenses and planning budgets have become easy and more efficient. In fact, one of the most used fintech offerings to date is a&nbsp;<a href="https://mobile-payment.financesonline.com/">mobile budgeting app</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Either for personal and business purposes, budgeting apps allow anyone to easily ad effectively closely monitor their expenses, income, and other finances. These wonderful apps have truly transformed how consumers see and perform their financial activities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Consumer Banking</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another fintech category that’s taking the world by storm is consumer banking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At this day and age,&nbsp;<a href="https://globalfindex.worldbank.org/">about 1.7 billion adults remain without a bank account or access to a mobile money provider</a>. This is mainly because traditional banks had been operating in ways that marginalize many impoverished people.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Banks’ exorbitant fees, for instance, make it impossible for the average Joe to use their services. Fintech’s alternative consumer banking products and services are designed to address this long-standing issue. By making financial products more accessible and affordable, fintech firms provide a better alternative for consumers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Innovative fintech banking examples abound. From mobile banks to online digital banks, fintech banks are changing banking as we know it.</p>

<h4>Robo-Advising and Stock-Trading Apps</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In recent years, robo-advising has altered the asset management sector. This innovative fintech service uses smart algorithm technology to provide intuitive asset recommendations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Robo-advising, in effect, portfolio management has achieved unprecedented efficiency, including lowering its costs. Financial advisers can now analyze numerous portfolio options more efficiently, 24/7, simultaneously. No wonder, an increasing number of robo-advising services continue to emerge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another popular and highly innovative fintech contribution is the invention of stock-trading apps.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the past, investors must physically visit stock exchange establishments to buy and sell stocks. Today, stock trading solutions allow investors to easily trade stocks at the flick of a finger on their smartphones.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With cheaper and low-minimum stock-trading apps in the market, investing had never been easier. Thanks to these fintech innovations, making those stock-trading apps can now be done anywhere, without any budgetary constraints</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h4>Insurance</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fintech firms have also entered the large insurance market as well, but offering better services than conventional insurers. Most insurtech firms are involved in distributing insurance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Insurtechs are optimizing the use of innovative insurance apps to make more people insured. Like what it does in other industries, fintechs are making insurance more accessible to the underserved masses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Firms in this category are typically collaborating with conventional insurers to automate insurance procedures and extend coverage. Insurtechs have a myriad of areas to innovate, from wearables for health insurance to mobile care insurance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Crucial to insurance innovation is the removal of cumbersome and time-intensive processes. With fintech-provided insurance,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/db833e5a-6eb1-11e6-a0c9-1365ce54b926">anyone can now buy car insurance in just a few hours.</a></p>

<h4>Blockchain and Cryptocurrency</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Is blockchain a fintech? Yes. In fact, if there are fintech innovations that truly stand out from the rest, they’re got to be blockchains and cryptocurrencies. This is because these new technologies are offering great potential to significantly improve various industries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blockchain uses encryption technology to create cryptocurrencies, a promising new medium of exchange that is more secure and better than cash. In effect, blockchains offer vast possibilities to disrupt and change conventional business models.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, leading organizations from various industries have already achieved significant benefits from blockchains and cryptocurrencies. These include reduced costs, faster transactions, enhanced efficiency, better traceability, improved security, and increased transparency.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
